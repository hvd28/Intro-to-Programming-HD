About

Hey, I’m Hannah.

With a degree in Design & Merchandising from Drexel University and years of Food, Beverage & Hospitality work under my belt, I’m one of the great many people out there working hard to make a major career change and move into programming and STEM at large. When I’m not on the clock or studying, I can typically be found watching Iron Chef or playing The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild for the 47th time. 

Experience

I am currently in an introductory programming course through an excellent organization called Code the Dream. Check back for updates!
