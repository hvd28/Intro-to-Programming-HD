        <h1>About</h1>

        Hey, I’m Hannah.

        <p>With a degree in Design & Merchandising from Drexel University and years of Food, Beverage & Hospitality work
            under my belt, I’m one of the great many people out there working hard to make a major career change and
            move into programming and STEM at large. When I’m not on the clock or studying, I can typically be found
            watching Iron Chef or playing The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild for the 47th time.</p>
